# covid19demo
This is a Flask app which uses chart.js to visualize the data from http://covidtracking.com

## Running the webserver code
You can run the code by downloading it, unzipping it, and giving the command
``` linux
% python webserver_covid19.py
```
which will start the webserver on your computer.
You can then view the data by going to the URL http://127.0.0.1:4000
You will need to install the flask module to get this to work.
Use either
``` linux
% conda install flask
or
% pip install flask
```
and if neither of these look familiar, then google "installing python packages" to learn how to do this.


## Running the Jupyter notebook code
You can also run the Jupyter notebook code by downloading this repository, cd'ing to the jupyterdemo folder
and giving the command
``` linux
% jupyter notebook
```
You will have to have installed the Jupyter lab modules... Google is your friend, ask her how to do it!
